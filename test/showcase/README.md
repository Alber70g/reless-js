# Reless-js showcase

This directory `test/showcase` is primarily to see how this library works.

You can find 4 examples in the `/test/showcase.test.js` testfile. 
The unfinished examples can be found in `/test/showcase.unfixed.js`. You can 
use these to try out how it works.

To run the tests run `npm test -- --watch` on the commandline.
Now you can change the tests and they will run automatically.
